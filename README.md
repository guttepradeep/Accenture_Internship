# Accenture_Internship
# Short summery What i have done in that project i have mention in it:-

# I processed and merged multiple datasets.
**step1:-**
I began by gathering data from three sources: ratings, content, and ratings_type. 

**step2:-**
data cleaning, I merged these CSV files into a single DataFrame and removed rows with missing values.

**step3:-**
data manipulation, I calculated total scores for each category and identified the top 5 categories based on these scores. 
data merging phase, I combined the ratings data with the content data to get the Category and URL, and further merged the result with ratings_type data based on Type.
I ensured the Content ID was used correctly for merging and converted scores to numerical types for analysis.
I saved the processed data, with the top 5 categories saved to top_5_categories.csv and the final merged dataset saved to final_dataset.csv. 

**Final:-**
I created a bar chart to display the scores of the top 5 categories and a pie chart to show the score distribution among these categories.
